               <p>Bob and Sheila, owner-operators of Paradise Connections Yacht Charters, are experienced sailors whose goal is<br> to assist you in finding the best boat for your charter yacht sailing vacation.
               </p>

                 Bob grew up around boats in Southern California, while Sheila's only boating experience was riding a ferry a<br> couple of times. We met, got married and went to France in 1980. We lived on a p√©niche (French barge) for <br>a few years on the Seine river outside of Paris. This is where we got the boat-building bug.
               </p>

               <p>After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a large project -- a 26-foot liveaboard sailboat. <br>Within six months we were living aboard Loose Moose on the Marne river east of Paris.</p>

           <h1>What We Do</h1>
           <p>love love love... We are a bit different to other <br>charter yacht brokers. The crew of Paradise <br>Connections live in the Caribbean islands year <br>round aboard our personal sail boat. We keep <br>in touch with the boats and crews as they are <br>our friends and neighbors.</p>
